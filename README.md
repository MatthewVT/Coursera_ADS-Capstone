# Coursera_ADS-Capstone

This project makes use of historic NYSE data around the years 2010 - 2016 and attempts to predict stock prices by means of the LSTM method.This Data Science Project involved:

* ETL and brief data overview 
* Feature creation 
* Data normalisation 
* Creating test and training data 
* Using Keras and Tensorflow to simulate models 
* Data denormalisation 
* Plotting graphs showing results 
* Checking model performance using the MSE method 
* Model optimisation 

This repository contains the files used to complete the IBM Advanced Data Science Capstone course. 

The jupyter notebook "Analysing the NYSE Data.ipynb" is uploaded as a pdf "Jupyter Notebook.pdf" if there are issues trying to render the jupyter notebook file.
