# Coursera_ADS-Capstone

This project makes use of historic NYSE data around the years 2010 - 2016 and attempts to predict stock prices by means of the LSTM method.

This repository contains the files used to complete the IBM Advanced Data Science Capstone course. 

The jupyter notebook "Analysing the NYSE Data.ipynb" is uploaded as a pdf "Jupyter Notebook.pdf" if there are issues trying to render the jupyter notebook file.
